# Bark-Park-Finder
# Description
The immediate goal of this web-app is to find the nearest off leash dog park to where you are currently located, or to where you choose on google maps. What we offer that google maps dosen't is that anyone can make an account on our site and check in to the park they are currently at. When another user (logged in or not) looks at a dog park all the people currently checked in will appear on screen so they know how many other dogs are there.
